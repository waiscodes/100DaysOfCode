1. Your application should include a prompt explaining the purpose of the application and how it should be operated to the user
2. Your application should allow a user to input a maximum of 10 numbers to an array
3. Your application should continue to ask the user to input numbers until all 10 slots have been filled in the array, or the escape sequence “done” is entered - all unfilled array slots should be ignored
4. Given an array of numbers, the application should pull all odd numbers and sort them from lowest to highest, then the application should pull all even numbers and sort them from lowest to highest before outputting the entire array to the user (example - [6, 4, 3, 7, 8] would become [3, 7, 4, 6, 8])
5. You must write a method for your sort code, which main() calls on - your application must not have the sorting code in main().
Add an item

Initialize arrays
evenArr 10
oddArr 10

Explain purpose: This application sorts numbers you enter in order from lowest to highest with evens first and odds second.

for loop to populate array that runs 10 times 
    try
        Prompt User: Please enter a number between 1-10 or type "done". 
        if (number is even)
            add to even array
        else if (number is odd)
            add to odd array 
        else if (not between 1-10)
            prompt user to try again
            decrement count by one
    catch
        if (input == "done")
            return
        else
            not a valid number please try again
            decrement the count by one

Call method for evenArr
Call method for oddArr

Create a method to sort numbers
    array.sort()
    for loop to print array
        if (if it doesn't contain zero)
            write to the console
