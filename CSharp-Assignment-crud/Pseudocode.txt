Limit the number of items the user can enter to 10.
Exit the program when the user enters a sentinel value of your choice (make sure to tell the user what it is).

Initialize an int array with 10 elements

Populate Array using a for loop
    Wrap in a try block

            break
        if user's input is "done"
            display array using a for loop

                    concat index + 1 with array
        else
