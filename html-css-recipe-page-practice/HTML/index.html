        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <section>
          <h5>Did you know?</h5>
          <p>
            Do you know what they call a Royale with Cheese in America? A
            quarter pounder. They don't understand metric systems. They call Le
            Big Mac just a Big Mac.

        <h3>Direction</h3>
        <section>
          <h5>Follow steps carefully or Jule and Vince might not be happy</h5>
          <h5>Step 1</h5>
          <p>
            Preheat grill for direct-heat cooking. Gently form beef into 4
            patties, each 4 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick (do not
            overwork meat or patties will be tough). Season generously with salt
            and pepper. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise onto the cut sides of
            each bun.
          </p>
          <h5>Step 2</h5>
          <p>
            Place patties on grill and cook, uncovered, until browned and
            sizzling on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, top each with a slice
            of cheese, cover grill, and cook until cheese is melted and patties
            are medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Place
            buns on grill cut-side down; cook just until lightly toasted and
            golden brown in places, about 1 minute.
          </p>
          <h5>Step 3</h5>
          <p>
            Dress the cut side of each bottom bun with ketchup and mayonnaise
            (or desired condiments), then top with patties. Place a tomato slice
            on top of each patty and season with salt. Stack with pickles and
            lettuce. Dress cut side of top buns with condiments, then sandwich
            toppings and serve.

        <h3>Variations</h3>
        <section>
          <h5>Havarti, Cucumber, and Dill</h5>
          <p>
            Swap out American cheese for sliced Havarti. Swap out tomato,
            pickles, and iceberg for thinly sliced cucumber seasoned with salt,
            shaved red onion, and fresh dill. Serve with Dijon mustard and
            mayonnaise or desired condiments.
          </p>
          <h5>Feta, Grilled Onions, and Radicchio</h5>
          <p>
            Swap out American cheese for 4 ounces feta cut into slices or
            crumbled. Swap out iceberg for thinly sliced radicchio, lightly
            tossed with red-wine vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil and seasoned
            with salt. Omit tomato and pickles. Slice a sweet onion, such as
            Vidalia, into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Brush with olive oil and season
            with salt and pepper. Grill, turning once, until charred in places
            and crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
          </p>
          <h5>Fontina, Grilled Mushrooms, and Arugula</h5>
          <p>
            Swap out American cheese for sliced Fontina. Swap out iceberg for
            arugula. Omit tomato and pickles. Halve 8 ounces cremini mushrooms
            (about 2 cups), brush with olive oil, and season with salt and
            pepper. Grill, turning a few times, until charred in places and
            tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve with whole-grain mustard or desired
            condiments.
