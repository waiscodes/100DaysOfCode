      <h2>Series synopsis</h2>
      The Kingkiller Chronicle is presented as the autobiography of Kvothe, an
      adventurer and famous musician, legendary throughout the Four Corners of
      Civilization. The plot is divided into two different action threads:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The frame story, where Kote tells the story of his life to Chronicler
          in the Waystone Inn.
        </li>
        <li>
          The narration, which comprises the story of Kote's past as Kvothe and
          makes up the majority of the books.
        </li>
      </ol>

      The series alternates between the third and first person perspective. The
      present-day interludes are in the third person, alternating from an
      omniscient perspective to that of several characters, while the story of
      Kvothe's life is told entirely in the first person from his own
      perspective. The series also contains many metafictional
      stories-within-stories from varying perspectives, which are described
      within the context of the narration.

      <h2>Book 1: Name of the Wind</h2>
      <p>
        This is the riveting first-person narrative of Kvothe, a young man who
        grows to be one of the most notorious magicians his world has ever seen.
        From his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a
        near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet
        successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, The Name of the
        Wind is a masterpiece that transports readers into the body and mind of
        a wizard.

      <h2>Book 2: The Wise Man's Fear</h2>
      In The Wise Man’s Fear, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover
      the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his
      parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem
      mercenaries, forced to reclaim the honor of his family, and travels into
      the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can
      resist, and who no man has ever survived…until Kvothe. Now, Kvothe takes
      his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can
      be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.

      <h2>Book 3: The Doors of Stone</h2>
      <p>
        The Doors of Stone will pick-up the story of Kvothe's life from where
        The Wise Man's Fear left off. It will cover the third and final day of
        the story as related to Chronicler, concluding "Kvothe's story" and the
        "arc" begun in The Name of the Wind. However, Rothfuss intends to create
        more works set in Temerant.
